<h1>About Timetable AI</h1>

<p>
Timetable AI is an education-focused web application designed to help college students generate
clash-free academic timetables quickly and efficiently.
</p>

<p>
In many colleges, students face difficulties during course registration due to overlapping class
slots, limited faculty availability, and complex schedules. Manually comparing different
timetable combinations is time-consuming and error-prone.
</p>

<h2>The Problem Students Face</h2>

<p>
During course enrollment, students often have to choose between multiple sections of the same
subject. Each section may be taught by a different faculty member and scheduled at different
times across the week.
</p>

<p>
Students usually want:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>No class timing clashes</li>
  <li>Preferred faculty members</li>
  <li>Balanced daily schedules</li>
  <li>Free days when possible</li>
</ul>

<p>
Without proper tools, students rely on trial-and-error or manual comparisons, which can lead to
poor scheduling decisions.
</p>

<h2>How Timetable AI Works</h2>

<p>
Timetable AI uses a structured optimization approach to analyze all possible combinations of
selected courses and sections.
</p>

<p>
Users can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Paste their official timetable data</li>
  <li>Select the courses they want to enroll in</li>
  <li>Set preferences such as avoiding early morning classes or preferring certain faculty</li>
  <li>Generate multiple optimized timetable options</li>
</ul>

<p>
The system evaluates each possible timetable based on multiple factors and ranks them, helping
students choose the most suitable option.
</p>

<h2>Who Is This Platform For?</h2>

<p>
Timetable AI is built primarily for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Undergraduate and postgraduate college students</li>
  <li>Students enrolling in institutions with complex timetable structures</li>
  <li>Anyone who wants to reduce stress during course registration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Faculty Reviews and Insights</h2>

<p>
The platform also allows students to share anonymous faculty feedback.
These insights help future students make informed decisions while selecting course sections.
</p>

<p>
All reviews are stored anonymously, and no personally identifiable information is displayed
publicly.
</p>

<h2>Monetization Model</h2>

<p>
Timetable AI follows a transparent credit-based model.
</p>

<p>
Users can access basic functionality for free, while advanced features such as multiple timetable
generation options may require purchasing credits.
</p>

<p>
Payments are handled securely through trusted third-party payment providers.
</p>

<h2>Our Goal</h2>

<p>
Our goal is to simplify academic planning and help students make confident decisions about their
course schedules.
</p>

<p>
Timetable AI is continuously improving based on student feedback and real-world usage.
